        The Vintech store is an online/ecommerce store based in Atlanta, Georgia. 
        We serve our customers with vintage electronics and gadgets that are hard 
        to find in common day to day stores. We don't take pride in trying to sell 
        our customers the latest and greatest products that will only come to be outdated 
        within a year's time. Instead, our focus to enlighten our customers with legendary 
        products that have served as a staple within the technological history.

        We offer a 30 return warranty for all of our products, but our customers rarely 
        return them becuase of how well we have preserved our gadgets.
